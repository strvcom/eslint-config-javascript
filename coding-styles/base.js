    // Require braces in arrow function body
    // This rule can enforce the use of braces around arrow function body.
    'arrow-body-style': [1, 'as-needed'],

    // Require parens in arrow function arguments
    // Arrow functions can omit parentheses when they have exactly one parameter. Since their main
    // strength lies in being short and concise, parens around arguments should be omitted when they
    // are not needed.
    'arrow-parens': [1, 'as-needed'],

    // Require space before/after arrow function's arrow
    'arrow-spacing': [1, {
      before: true,
      after: true
    }],

    // Enforce spacing around the * in generator functions
    // This rule enforces that the * is placed together with the `function` keyword. The reasoning
    // is that a generator function is a special type of function, therefore it should come together
    // with the `function` keyword. In contrast, it has nothing to do with the function's name,
    // which may be missing completely.
    'generator-star-spacing': [1, {

    }],

    // Require Following Curly Brace Conventions
    // This rule is aimed at preventing bugs and increasing code clarity by ensuring that block
    // statements are wrapped in curly braces.
    // All block statements must be wrapped in curly braces
    curly: [1, 'all'],

    // Enforce newline before and after dot
    // This rule aims to enforce newline consistency in member expressions. This rule prevents the
    // use of mixed newlines around the dot in a member expression.
    // Require the dot to be placed together with the property identifier
    'dot-location': [1, 'property'],

    // Require Dot Notation
    // This rule is aimed at maintaining code consistency and improving code readability by
    // encouraging use of the dot notation style whenever possible.
    'dot-notation': 1,

    // Disallow return in else
    // If an if block contains a return statement, the else block becomes unnecessary. Its contents
    // can be placed outside of the block.
    'no-else-return': 1,

    // Disallow multiple spaces
    // This rule aims to disallow multiple whitespace around logical expressions, conditional
    // expressions, declarations, array elements, object properties, sequences and function

    camelcase: [1, {
      properties: 'always'
    }],

    // Enforces spacing around commas
    // This rule aims to enforce spacing around a comma.
    // A space must be only after comma, i.e. `var a, b`

    // Comma style

    // Disallow or enforce spaces inside of computed properties
    // This rule aims to maintain consistency around the spacing inside of computed properties.

    // This rule designates a variable as the chosen alias for `this`.

    // as output files to the terminal without interfering with shell prompts.
    'eol-last': [1, 'unix'],

    // Enforce Function Style
    // Due to these different behaviors, it is common to have guidelines as to which style of
    // function should be used. There is really no correct or incorrect choice here, it is just a
    // preference. A good reason to use function declarations is that the function names then appear
    // in stack traces which help during debugging.

    'max-nested-callbacks': [1, 4],

    // Specify the Maximum Number of Statements Allowed per Line
    // A line of code containing too many statements can be difficult to read. Code is generally
    // read from the top down, especially when scanning, so limiting the number of statements
    // allowed on a single line can be very beneficial for readability and maintainability.
    'max-statements-per-line': 1,

    // Require Constructors to Use Initial Caps
    // This rule is aimed at helping to distinguish regular functions from constructor functions. As

    'new-parens': 1,

    // Require or disallow an empty newline after variable declarations
    // This rule enforces a coding style where empty newlines are required after var, let, or const

    // Disallow trailing spaces at the end of lines
    // Sometimes in the course of editing files, you can end up with extra whitespace at the end of

    // Require a newline around variable declarations

    // inside for loop conditionals.
    'one-var-declaration-per-line': 1,

    // Operator Assignment Shorthand
