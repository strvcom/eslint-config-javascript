# Migrating from @strv/eslint-config-javascript

The new project hosted at [@strvcom/code-quality-tools][cqt-home] provides all the functionality which was included in this repository, with the only exception being the **flow** ruleset which has been removed. The `v1.0.0` versions of all packages hosted there are 1:1 compatible with the latest version of `@strv/eslint-config-javascript` (`9.2.0`), therefore no new errors or warnings should be reported after the migration.

- Uninstall `@strv/eslint-config-javascript`
- Open your _.eslintrc.js_ file and check which rulesets you use
- Based on the table below, replace the rulesets in your config file with the new names
- Install the missing rulesets

|Old ruleset|New ruleset|package|
|-|-|-|
|`@strv/javascript/environments/nodejs/*`|`@strv/node/*`|[`@strv/eslint-config-node`][es-node-home]|
|`@strv/javascript/environments/react/*`|`@strv/react/*`|[`@strv/eslint-config-react`][es-react-home]|
|`@strv/javascript/environments/mocha/*`|`@strv/mocha/*`|[`@strv/eslint-config-mocha`][es-mocha-home]|
|`@strv/javascript/environments/typescript/*`|`@strv/typescript/*`|[`@strv/eslint-config-typescript`][es-ts-home]|
|`@strv/javascript/environments/flow/*`|üî•|Removed without replacement üò±|
|`@strv/javascript/coding-styles/*`|üî•|Coding style rulesets are now part of the environment-specific packages ‚ù§Ô∏è|

The following rulesets have been removed as part of the migration:

- `@strv/javascript/environments/nodejs/v6`
- `@strv/javascript/environments/nodejs/v8-3`
- `@strv/javascript/environments/flow/*`
- `@strv/javascript/coding-styles/*`

## ...but why?

### More granular release cycle

Separating the environments into dedicated packages will reduce noise when a new version for a specific environment is released. Before, when a new rule has been added to the `nodejs` ruleset, everyone received an upgrade even if they only used the `react` ruleset and did not care about changes to the `nodejs` ruleset. With the new setup, each environment will follow its own semver release cycle.

### Not just ESLint anymore

The new repository contains configurations for a bunch of other linting tools, not just ESLint. We wanted to keep all these configs under a single roof, so we decided to move the code over there.
